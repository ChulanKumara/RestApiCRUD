# Atmoz backend challenge

Welcome to the Atmoz Backend Challenge. This test is designed to showcase your technical expertise and problem-solving skills. It's an opportunity for both of us: for you to demonstrate your capabilities, and for us to understand how you tackle technical challenges. We look forward to seeing your solutions. Best of luck! 

We expect you to take around 3 to 4 hours to solve this challenge. Don't worry if you can't finish everything you want to make the perfect submission, rather, the goal is to have some code to have a discussion about during the interview.

If you have any questions, you can either open an issue in this repository or email luna.duclos@atmoz.io

## Introduction

A key feature of the platform we are building here at Atmoz, is to convert purchases into a categorized breakdown of emissions to give companies an overview of their biggest sources of emission. In this assignment we want you to implement a CRUD API for `EmissionBreakdownRow` objects.

## Assignment

Implement the given REST API specification defined in the [EmissionBreakdownController](EmissionBreakdownApi/Controllers/EmissionBreakdownController.cs).

### Objectives 
- Implement the REST Service’s API 
- Respect the REST API’s specification 
- Add simple integration tests 

### Tips 
- **Adhere to the API Specification**: Your primary goal is to implement the REST API  
- **Readability**: Write clear, well-organized code. A consistent coding style is appreciated. 
- **Keep It Simple**: Focus on fulfilling the core requirements of the assignment. Simplicity and functionality are key. You may add code not strictly part of the requirements if you feel it is necessary to meet them but keep it minimal. It's fine to use simple implementations if they are sufficient to meet the objectives, or even stub out certain logic if it'd be too time consuming to implement it in the given time.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET 8.0 SDK
- Your favorite code editor


### Setup

- Clone the repository:

```
git clone "<repo URL>"
```

- Navigate to the repository:

```
cd "<repo name>"
```

- Build the solution:

```
dotnet build
```

### Submission

You are free to create a branch and push to it as often as you’d like. Once you’re ready for us to have a look, please submit a pull request with a short description of your approach. You are free to add comments to any code you want as well if there is anything you want us to know about any of the code.
If there is anything you are particularly proud of or want to higlight, or found challenging, please do feel free to highlight that there as well.

## Closing remarks

Good luck with your challenge!

We want to respect your time, and expect you to spend around 2 to 3 hours on this challenge.

It's fine if you can't get everything you want in done in this time, make sure your code builds and runs, and add comments in your PR as to what additional things you'd have added if you had more time.

If you have any questions, you can either open an issue in this repository or email luna.duclos@atmoz.io
